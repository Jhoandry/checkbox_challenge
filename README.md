# Checkbox Challenge

This project is a styled checkbox that preserves the accessibility of a native checkbox (keyboard toggle), ussing plain HTML, CSS, and JS (with no third-party libraries and frameworks).

## Fucntionality

* The custom checkbox is styled similar to what you see in the video (find a checkmark SVG in Assets below).
* Clicking the native checkbox, the custom checkbox is displayed and checked as well.
* Clicking the custom checkbox, the native checkbox is checked as well.
* Using the keyboard (tab), when the native checkbox is focused, a blue line appears around the custom checkbox.
* Using the keyboard (tab), when the native checkbox has focus and the user presses space, the native checkbox is selected as well as the custom checkbox.
* When hiding the native checkbox, the native accessibility (keyboard navigation: tab, space) is preserved for the custom checkbox.

## Run locally

* Copy `index.html` path file  and open on your browser. Just that simple :smiley:!
